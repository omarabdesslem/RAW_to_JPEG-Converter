As a photographer who uses .RAW, I know first hand that pro photos take a massive amount of space. Sometimes, more than 50GB right after a trip! To save space and keep my holiday photos, I've developed this program. It converts .RAW photos to smaller more space friendly JPEG Quality!

This way, you choose the best photos to keep at .PNG / .RAW and convert the rest to JPEGs!
It is very easy to use :)



#Features
RAW to JPEG Conversion:
Converts popular RAW file formats (e.g., .nef, .cr2, .cr3, .arw, .dng) into JPEG format.
Adjustable JPEG Quality:
Allows you to specify the desired JPEG quality percentage (from 1 to 100) when performing the conversion.
Recursive Directory Traversal:
Processes all images in the specified folder and its subdirectories, maintaining the original folder structure in the output.
Non-RAW File Handling:
Automatically copies non-RAW files to the output directory to preserve the complete file hierarchy.


#How To Run:
Simply run the script from the command line by providing the path to the folder containing your images and the desired JPEG quality percentage. For example:

./advanced_image_converter.py /path/to/images 85
